Modified travel time of Gantry Crane 4 Offload to be 1.1 minute for a TEU based on a crane rate of 25 TEU per hour (PEV website says 2.5 minutes in or out for boom shuttle time of 2 TEU).  Modified Loading Dock 4 based on video 20170427_165933.mp4.  Loading Dock 4 to Crowley can take up to 5 trucks at a time holding 2 TEU a piece (doubled capacity).  Holding time at Crowley is 270.  Exit to Gate is up to 5 trucks at a time holding 2 TEU a piece.  Gate can handle up to 5 trucks at a time.",
