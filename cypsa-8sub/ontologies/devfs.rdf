    <rdfs:comment>A computer file is a resource for storing
    information, which is available to a computer program and is
    usually based on some kind of durable storage. A file is "durable"
    in the sense that it remains available for other programs to use
    after the program that created it has finished executing. Computer
    files can be considered as the modern counterpart of paper
    documents which traditionally are kept in office and library
    files, and this is the source of the
    term. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">File Path</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>A path, the general form of the name of a file or
    directory, specifies a unique location in a file system. A path
    points to a file system location by following the directory tree
    hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path
    components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each
    directory. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Directory</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>In computing, a directory is a file system
    cataloging structure which contains references to other computer
    files, and possibly other
    directories. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing))</rdfs:comment>
