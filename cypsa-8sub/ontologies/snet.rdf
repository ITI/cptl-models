    <rdfs:comment>A remote terminal unit (RTU) is a

    <rdfs:comment>A network switch (also called switching hub,
    bridging hub, officially MAC bridge[1]) is a computer networking
    device that connects devices together on a computer network, by
    using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the
    destination device. Unlike less advanced network hubs, a network
    switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to
    receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of
    its ports. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch)</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Distance Relay</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The most common form of protection on high voltage transmission
    systems is distance relay protection.  Power lines have set impedance per kilometre and using 
    this value and comparing voltage and current the distance to a fault can be determined.

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Reverse Power Relay</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment> A reverse power relay is a directional power relay
    that is used to monitor the power from a generator running in
    parallel with another generator or the utility. The function of
    the reverse power relay is to prevent a reverse power condition in
    which power flows from the bus bar into the generator. This
    condition can occur when there is a failure in the prime mover
    such as an engine or a turbine which drives the
    generator. (http://www.electrotechnik.net/2009/06/reverse-power-relay-function-and.html)</rdfs:comment>
